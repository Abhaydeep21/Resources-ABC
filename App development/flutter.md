<h1 align="center"> Roadmap To Become a Flutter Developer </h1>

## What is Flutter?
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google used for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for [mobile]{https://flutter.dev/docs}, [web]{https://flutter.dev/web}, and [desktop]{https://flutter.dev/desktop} from a single codebase.
<br>

## Why Flutter?
We already know there are a lot of frameworks out there that provide the cross-platform functionality then what makes flutter standalone in this rat race?
* Fast Development
* Expressive and flexible User Interface
* Native performance

<br>

## What to start with First?
Flutter is fast and easy, If you are familiar with java or any object-oriented language you are good to go but even If you are not no need to worry all you need is basic knowledge of <b>DART</b> language to start working with flutter.
<br>
These are few of the videos that you might find helpful to understand basics of Dart Programming.

 [Install]{https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install}
 

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop 
applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a 
single codebase. Flutter apps are written in the Dart language. Dart syntax is easy to understand 
for JavaScript or Java developers as it supports most of the object-oriented concepts. Flutter 
works with any development tool (or none at all) but includes editor plug-ins for both 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) / [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

<br>

Android app development has separate files for front-end and back-end, whereas Flutter uses 
a single language for front and back end and uses a reactive framework.
