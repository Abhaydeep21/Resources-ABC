Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop 
applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia and the web from a 
single codebase. Flutter apps are written in the Dart language. Dart syntax is easy to understand 
for JavaScript or Java developers as it supports most of the object-oriented concepts. Flutter 
works with any development tool (or none at all) but includes editor plug-ins for both 
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) / [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

Android app development has separate files for front-end and back-end, whereas Flutter uses 
a single language for front and back end and uses a reactive framework.
