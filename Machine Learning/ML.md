Machine learning (ML) is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through 
experience. It is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being 
explicitly programmed. It is a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is 
difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

<b> 1) ) ML + Python (scikit-learn) </b>
The programming languages used in machine learning are Python, Matlab, R. Python if a most 
popular language for machine learning. There are various python libraries used in machine 
learning but the 5 most important and frequently used ones are

* Scipy
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Sklearn

<b>  ML + Weka (no code) </b>
Weka is a software which can be used to work on machine learning algorithms without use of 
any programming language. Weka is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data 
mining tasks. The algorithms can either be applied directly to a dataset or called from your own 
Java code. Weka contains tools for data pre-processing, classification, regression, clustering, 
association rules, and visualization.

##  To Setup Your Python Environment for Machine Learning with Anaconda

Follow [this](https://machinelearningmastery.com/setup-python-environment-machine-learning-deep-learning-anaconda/)

Anaconda navigator provides information about various Ide that can be used for working on 
machine learning projects. The most common text editor used for writing machine learning code in python is <b>Jupyter</b>(if you want to work in offline mode) and <b>Google Colab</b>(for online working). 
Google Colab 
is a cloud based environment product by google for working with python projects
