Hey there, if you have been going through various articles and videos on how to start building your own cool websites, well you are at the right place. Don’t get too overwhelmed by the tons of languages and frameworks you have to learn. Because it’s all simple and interconnected. You learn one, you easily get the hang of the rest. So, if you are here to learn how to get started with front-end development, CONGRATULATIONS, you have made a great choice.

## Who are full stack developers
There are backend developers who make APIs, design and manage the database and perform all the operations which enable the website to perform tasks and play with the data. And, then there are frontend developers who design the frontend of the website and make it responsive and user friendly. They build web pages to let the backend interact with the user. <br>
So, a full stack developer is a developer who can do both these tasks. A full-stack developer can build a complete website on its own since he does both the sides by himself.
<br>
The perfect way to become a full-stack developer is to specialize in one part — Frontend or Backend and then have a working knowledge of the other, and then improve it.

## Basic Requirement for both paths
* Learn Git and Github
* Learn Command Line
* Learn programming language

## Frontend Developer Roadmap
Frontend Development is the interface of the website — the part user interacts with. The frontend is responsible for the interaction between users and the backend of the application. <br>
Frontend development is not only limited to HTML, CSS and simple Javascript. There are a lot of frameworks which help us design good frontends for our websites and make our work easier.
