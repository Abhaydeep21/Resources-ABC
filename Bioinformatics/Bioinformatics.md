<h2 align="center">What is Bioinformatics </h2>
It is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for 
understanding biological data, in particular when the data sets are large and complex. As an 
interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, computer 
science, information engineering, mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret 
the biological data.

## Pre-Requiesties :pen:
A moderate knowledge of biology and some basics of data and its working.

## Software
* <b>AUTODOCK - </b> AutoDock is molecular modeling simulation software. It is especially 
effective for protein-ligand docking. AutoDock 4 is available under the GNU General 
Public License. AutoDock is one of the most cited docking software applications in the 
research community

* <b>ANDURIL -</b> Anduril is an analysis and integration framework that facilitates the 
design, use, parallelization and reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows.

* <b>GENEPATTERN -</b> GenePattern is a freely available computational 
biology open-source software package originally created and developed at the 
Broad Institute for the analysis of genomic data. Designed to enable 
researchers to develop, capture, and reproduce genomic analysis 
methodologies
