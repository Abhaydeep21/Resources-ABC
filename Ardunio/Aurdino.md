#Arduino

Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronics projects. Arduino consists of 
both a physical programmable circuit board (often referred to as a microcontroller) and a piece 
of software, or IDE (Integrated Development Environment) that runs on your computer, used 
to write and upload computer code to the physical board.

## Pre-requisties :pen:
C programming and basic electronic concepts such as voltage, current and resistance.

## Perks :star:
* THE BASIS for all amazing and awesome projects such as a robotic arm, Remote 
controlled car, Home sutomation projects etc.
* The basis to electronics
* The Perfect introduction to programming: Programming on Arduino is possible with 
any language, but it's best to start with the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development 
Environment). The IDE supports C and C++, and includes libraries for various hardware 
components, such as LEDs and switches. The programming language is super forgiving!
* One of the Easiest Technical skill one can pick up
